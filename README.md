Hi there 👋 I'm an <b>Embedded</b> and <b>Automotive</b> developer, with experience in dealing with robots framework🤖(i.e. ROS, Matlab) and microprocessor. <br><br>
I majored in <b>Electronic Engineering</b> and am currently working at <b>HMG</b>, where I have been involved not only in <b>Autosar ASW</b>,<br> but also in various development projects, including  <b>Full-stack Web/App</b>, <b>GUI desktop program</b> and <b>MATLAB Scripts(business tools or CI/CD/CT)</b>.<br>
<br>
### 💼In terms of business...
I have successfully planned and developed service to address inefficiencies, resulting in cost savings of approximately <b>140 million KRW</b> for the company.<br>
Furthermore, I enhanced and created MATLAB Automation, discovering ways to improve operational efficiency by <b>more than 50%</b> compared to previous processes.<br>
<br>
### In the Future...
<b>Identifying</b> and <b>Imporving inefficiencies</b> is not only something I enjoy, but also one of my strongest skills.<br> In the future, I am considering a path not only in service development but also as a service planner and designer.<br>
